        <p>
            Tests are written in a non-technical language that everyone can understand. 
            BDD combines the principles of TDD and ATDD and forms an approach for building a shared understanding on what kind of software to build by discussing examples. 
            BDD brings customers, end-users, BAs, QAs, and SEs of the software product into one table for effective sharing of knowledge on the system and its testing requirements.

            <p>BDD consists of cycles of a set of steps to follow:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify business feature.</li>
                <li>Identify scenarios under the selected feature.</li> 
                <li>Define steps for each scenario.</li>
                <li>Run feature and fail.</li>
                <li>Write code to make steps pass.</li>
                <li>Refactor code, Create reusable automation library.</li>
                <li>Run feature and pass.</li>
                <li>Generate test reports.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>
            Tests are written before code and passing the tests is the critical driver of development.

        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions. 
                It can also be looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application.

        <button class="accordion">Domain-driven design (DDD)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. 
                It means that the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. 
                For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.

            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Team members with different perspectives (customer, business analyst, tester, developer) collaborate
                 and write acceptance tests in advance of implementing the corresponding functionality.

            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Continuous test-driven development (CTDD)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                The developer writes a test first but is not forced to execute the tests manually. 
                The tests are run automatically by a continuous testing tool running in the background. 
                This technique can potentially reduce the time waste resulting from manual test execution by eliminating 
                the need for the developer to start the test after each phase of the normal TDD practice.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Specification by example (SBE)</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                A collaborative approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating
                 requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Data-driven development</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Relies on data to guide the development process. 
                It involves selecting and monitoring metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) that help you better understand your product 
                so you can make continuous improvements.
            </p>

        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Data-oriented design</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                A program optimization approach motivated by efficient usage of the CPU cache, used in video game development. 
                The approach is to focus on the data layout, separating and sorting fields according to when they are needed, and to think about transformations of data.
