    <h2>SDLC Models</h2>

<div class="panel" style="text-align: center;">

  <p>The waterfall model is a continuous software development model in 
      which development is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) 
      through the steps of requirements analysis, design, implementation, 
      testing (validation), integration, and maintenance.

      <p>Linear ordering of activities has some significant consequences. 
    First, to identify the end of a phase and the beginning of the next, 
    some certification techniques have to be employed at the end of each step. 
    Some verification and validation usually do this mean that will ensure that
    the output of the stage is consistent with its input (which is the output of the previous step),
    and that the output of the stage is consistent with the overall requirements of the system.</p>

<button class="accordion" style="text-align: center;font-size: medium;font-weight: bold">Prototyping</button>
<div class="panel" style="text-align: center;">
  <p>The prototyping model starts with the requirements gathering. 
      The developer and the user meet and define the purpose of the software, identify the needs, etc.

    <p>A 'quick design' is then created. This design focuses on those aspects of the software that will be visible to the user.
    It then leads to the development of a prototype. 
    The customer then checks the prototype, and any modifications or changes that are needed are made to the prototype.
    
    <p>Looping takes place in this step, and better versions of the prototype are created. 
    These are continuously shown to the user so that any new changes can be updated in the prototype. 
    This process continue until the customer is satisfied with the system. 
    Once a user is satisfied, the prototype is converted to the actual system with all considerations for quality and security.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"style="text-align: center;font-size: medium;font-weight: bold">Iterative</button>
<div class="panel" style="text-align: center;">
  <p>It is a particular implementation of a software development life cycle that focuses on an initial, 
    simplified implementation, which then progressively gains more complexity and a broader feature set 
    until the final system is complete. In short, iterative development is a way of breaking down the software development
     of a large application into smaller pieces.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"style="text-align: center;font-size: medium;font-weight: bold">Spiral</button>
<div class="panel"style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/what-is-software-development-6.png.webp" alt="" width="500px" >
  <p>The spiral model is a risk-driven process model. 
    This SDLC model helps the group to adopt elements of one or more process models like a waterfall, incremental, waterfall, etc.
    The spiral technique is a combination of rapid prototyping and concurrency in design and development activities.

    <p>Each cycle in the spiral begins with the identification of objectives for that cycle, 
        the different alternatives that are possible for achieving the goals, and the constraints that exist. 
        This is the first quadrant of the cycle (upper-left quadrant).
    
    <p>The next step in the cycle is to evaluate these different alternatives based on the objectives and constraints. 
        The focus of evaluation in this step is based on the risk perception for the project.
    
    <p>The next step is to develop strategies that solve uncertainties and risks. 
    This step may involve activities such as benchmarking, simulation, and prototyping.</p>

<button class="accordion"style="text-align: center;font-size: medium;font-weight: bold">V-Shape</button>
<div class="panel"style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/what-is-software-development-7.png.webp" alt="" width="500px" >
  <p>In this type of SDLC model testing and the development, the step is planned in parallel.
    So, there are verification phases on the side and the validation phase on the other side. 
    V-Model joins by Coding phase.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"style="text-align: center;font-size: medium;font-weight: bold">Agile</button>
<div class="panel"style="text-align:center;">
  <p>Agile methodology is a practice which promotes continues interaction of development and testing during the SDLC process
    of any project. In the Agile method, the entire project is divided into small incremental builds.
    All of these builds are provided in iterations, and each iteration lasts from one to three weeks.

    <p>Any agile software phase is characterized in a manner that addresses several key assumptions about the bulk of software projects:
    
       <p>1. It is difficult to think in advance which software requirements will persist and which will change. 
        It is equally difficult to predict how user priorities will change as the project proceeds.
      <p>2. For many types of software, design and development are interleaved. 
          That is, both activities should be performed in tandem so that design models are proven as they are created. 
          It is difficult to think about how much design is necessary before construction is used to test the configuration.
      <p>3. Analysis, design, development, and testing are not as predictable (from a planning point of view) as we might like.
